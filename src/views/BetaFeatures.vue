            Below you will find a list of the current features we are beta
            testing. I cannot promise these will be supported for any
            significant period of time or that they will ever see the light of
            day. I try to ensure that state is preserved in the url for a page,
            that means if you share the url, the person you share it with should
            see the exact same page as you. These features break that promise.
            Use at your own risk.

          <p class="pb-2 text-sm">
            In most fields there are papers which are considered "canonical" or
            are methods/tools papers. These papers tend to be cited by everyone
            in the field and their presence doesn't provide useful information
            to the graph. In fact, in many instances these papers create their
            own gravity and most graphs in the field end up centering around
            them, making the graph less useful.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 text-sm">
            When you use this feature, if a paper has more than the specified
            number of citations, then the graph builder will not pull in papers
            which cite that paper. The paper will still be present in the graph
            and it will still get citations if other papers in the graph cite
            it. The net effect is to dampen the papers impact on the overall
            graph. Please feel free to experiment with different levels. I
            reccomend starting high (5,000 or so) and working your way down to
            what feels right.
