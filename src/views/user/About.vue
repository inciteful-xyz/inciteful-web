        <p class="py-2">
          The seed of the idea for Inciteful came about as a result of a
          frustrating experience after helping my wife (the academic of the
          family) with some research. I was interested in a topic that was
          tangentially related to what she was working on but she wasn't
          familiar with that specific literature. As a result I went down a
          rabbit hole of going to Google Scholar to look for papers, scanning
          papers for references, looking at who cited those papers, and then
          returning to Google Scholar to repeat the process. All while keeping
          the results of my search in a notepad, noting connections between
          different papers to better understand how they are all related. After
          an embarrassingly long time, I realized I was just drawing a network
          graph. Probably an experience that most academics can relate to.

          My background is in Computer Science and am a developer by trade so my
          mind quickly jumped to how this whole process could be automated. I
          also have a bit of ADD so the interest in my original research
          question was quickly and easily overtaken by this new project.

          After spending the first year of life as a hacked together python
          notebook using the apis from

          and

            href="https://crossref.org"
            >Crossref</a

          use.

        <p class="py-2">
          The biggest problem was the real time creation of the graph. My
          original solution took over 15 minutes to build the graph for a paper
          with only a few citations and 40-50 references. It was clearly too
          slow. After a number of fits and starts, where I ended up learning a
          new programming language (<a
            class="text-purple-700 cursor-pointer hover:text-purple-500"
            href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"
            >Rust</a
          >), testing out a number of databases, changing the source of my data,
          and re-architecting the code a few times, I finally found a solution
          that I'm happy with and I hope you are too.

          As this is built upon the back of data that I received for free, it
          feels like bad karma to charge for the service. That being said, it's
          pretty expensive to keep the site up and running ($500/month) as the
          backend servers need to be pretty powerful to give a good experience
          to the end users. In the future I might start accepting donations to
          cover the cost of running the site or if you know of an institution
          who might be interested in sponsoring the project, an introduction
          would be appreciated.
