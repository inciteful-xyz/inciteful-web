            Semantic Scholar is a project developed at the Allen Institute for
            Artificial Intelligence. Publicly released in November 2015, it is
            designed to be an AI-backed search engine for academic publications.
            The project uses a combination of machine learning, natural language
            processing, and machine vision to add a layer of semantic analysis
            to the traditional methods of citation analysis, and to extract
            relevant figures, entities, and venues from papers. In comparison to
            Google Scholar and PubMed, Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight
            the most important and influential papers, and to identify the
            connections between them.
